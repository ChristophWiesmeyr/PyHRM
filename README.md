# PyHRM
High Resolution Melt Analysis in Python

I am surprised that no free software is available to do such simple data analysis. So with some opensource spirit, I decide to write my own and share it with fellow scientists.

You can view this ipython notebook demo here:

## How sensitive is pyHRM?

I am able to reliably detect:
* nfkb1-/- genetyping: WT vs HET vs KO; using original regular PCR primer
* an amplicon in nfkb2 gene that have single point T->G mutation: WT vs HET vs KO
* an amplicon in nfkb2 gene that have 4 base pair "TCCA" loss mutation: WT vs HET vs KO
